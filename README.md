# Linspo UI - Data Visualization Components

Linspo UI is a collection of reusable user interface components designed specifically for building data-driven web applications. It includes prebuilt elements such as data tables, filters, pagination controls, charts, summary cards, and layout grids optimized for analytics dashboards and reporting tools. The components are designed to display structured data clearly and consistently, supporting both dense tabular information and visual summaries.

Linspo UI also provides utilities for sorting, searching, and filtering datasets, as well as standardized typography and spacing for readable data layouts. It's built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring components are lightweight, responsive, and easy to integrate into existing projects. The focus is on data presentationâ€”making it easy to visualize, compare, and interact with key metrics without unnecessary styling or complexity.
